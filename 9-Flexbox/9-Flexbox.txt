Flex layouts have the following features, which you will be able to explore in this guide.

1.They can display as a row, or a column.
2.They respect the writing mode of the document.
3.They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.
4.Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.
5.Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.
6.Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.
7.The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.
